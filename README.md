Flashcard System Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract provides a decentralized flashcard management system. Users can create and view flashcards, with each flashcard containing a question, an answer, and a timestamp indicating its creation time.

Features
Create Flashcards: Users can create flashcards by providing a question and an answer. Each flashcard is assigned a unique ID.
View Flashcards: Users can retrieve the details of a specific flashcard using its ID.
Contract Details
Prerequisites
Solidity Version: ^0.8.0
License: MIT
State Variables
struct Flashcard:

question (string): The question text.
answer (string): The answer text.
timestamp (uint256): The creation time of the flashcard.
mapping(uint256 => Flashcard) public flashcards:

A mapping to store flashcards by their unique IDs.
uint256 public flashcardIdCounter:

A counter to generate unique IDs for flashcards.
Events
FlashcardCreated:
Emitted when a new flashcard is created.
Parameters:
uint256 indexed flashcardId: The unique ID of the flashcard.
string question: The question text.
string answer: The answer text.
Functions
1. createFlashcard(string calldata question, string calldata answer) external
Creates a new flashcard with the given question and answer.

Inputs:
question: The question for the flashcard.
answer: The answer to the question.
Requirements:
The question and answer must not be empty.
Effects:
Increments flashcardIdCounter to generate a unique ID.
Creates a new Flashcard struct.
Stores the flashcard in the flashcards mapping.
Event:
Emits FlashcardCreated upon successful creation.
2. viewFlashcard(uint256 flashcardId) external view returns (string memory question, string memory answer, uint256 timestamp)
Retrieves the details of a specific flashcard.

Inputs:
flashcardId: The ID of the flashcard to retrieve.
Outputs:
question: The question text.
answer: The answer text.
timestamp: The creation time of the flashcard.
Requirements:
The flashcard with the given ID must exist.
Usage
Deployment
Deploy the contract using any Ethereum-compatible environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat).
Interact with the contract by calling its functions.
Interaction
Create a Flashcard: Call createFlashcard with a non-empty question and answer.
View a Flashcard: Call viewFlashcard with the flashcard's unique ID to retrieve its details.
Security Notes
Ensure only valid flashcards are created by adhering to the input validation rules.
Invalid IDs in viewFlashcard will revert with an appropriate error.
